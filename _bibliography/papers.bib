  abstract     = {PennyLane is a Python 3 software framework for differentiable programming of quantum computers. The library provides a unified architecture for near-term quantum computing devices, supporting both qubit and continuous-variable paradigms. PennyLane's core feature is the ability to compute gradients of variational quantum circuits in a way that is compatible with classical techniques such as backpropagation. PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms common in optimization and machine learning to include quantum and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for hardware providers including the Xanadu Cloud, Amazon Braket, and IBM Quantum, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible quantum devices. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Autograd. PennyLane can be used for the optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, quantum machine learning models, and many other applications.}

We outline the Ising formulation for VRP and present a detailed procedure to solve VRP by minimizing its simulated Ising Hamiltonian using the IBM Qiskit platform. Here, we attempt to find solutions for the VRP problems: (4,2), (5,2), and (5,3), where each (n, k) represents a VRP problem with n locations and k vehicles. We find that the performance of QAOA is not just dependent upon the classical optimizer used, the number of steps $p$ in which an adiabatic path is realized, or the way parameters are initialized, but also on the problem instance itself.},

We present a method to calculate energy derivatives for both ground state and excited state energies with respect to the parameters of a chemical system based on the framework of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). A low-depth implementation of quantum circuits within the hybrid variational paradigm is designed, and their computational costs are analyzed. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by incorporating it in some key quantum chemistry applications of energy derivatives, such as to perform minimum energy configuration search and estimate molecular response properties estimation of H2 molecule, and also to find the transition state of H2 + H ↔ H + H2 reaction. The obtained results are shown to be in complete agreement with their respective full configuration interaction (FCI) values.}

Therefore, to execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on the hardware, compilers have to first perform the task of qubit routing, i.e., to transform the quantum circuit either by inserting additional SWAP gates or by reversing existing CNOT gates to satisfy the connectivity constraints of the target topology. We propose a procedure for qubit routing that is architecture agnostic and that outperforms other available routing implementations on various circuit benchmarks. The depth of the transformed quantum circuits is minimised by utilizing the Monte Carlo tree search to perform qubit routing, aided by a Graph neural network that evaluates the value function and action probabilities for each state.}

In this paper, we introduce a surface code design based on the fact that the severity of bit flip and phase flip errors in the physical quantum systems is asymmetric. For our proposed surface code design for asymmetric error channels, we present pseudo-threshold and threshold values in the presence of various degrees of asymmetry of Pauli $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ errors in a depolarization channel. We show that, compared to symmetric surface codes, our asymmetric surface codes can provide almost double the pseudo-threshold rates while requiring less than half the number of physical qubits in the presence of increasing asymmetry in the error channel. We also demonstrate that as the asymmetry of the surface code increases, the advantage in the pseudo-threshold rates begins to saturate for any degree of asymmetry in the channel.},

In this article, insights are given into the circuit-centric architecture design of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The dependence of the circuit size, circuit depth on the interaction and connection between different qubits present in quantum hardware are discussed. A noise-aware procedure is presented which helps in determining the optimal interactions between different qubits of a quantum chip to execute a given circuit in the most efficient way possible. In this article, the 5-qubit hardware in a noiseless setting is illustrated with an example. Also, a benchmark-driven analysis is performed to show the importance of noise adaptivity in determining the hardware reliability. It is concluded that a generalized and flexible procedure such as this approach can aid in determining the design of hardware accurately for which the circuit runs efficiently, that is, with the least number of clock cycles, the lowest gate operations, and noise-based errors.},

Given the intrinsic quantum nature of these problems, it is natural to speculate that quantum-enhanced machine learning will enable us to unveil even greater details than we currently have. With this motivation, this paper examines a quantum machine learning approach based on shallow variational ansatz inspired by tensor networks for supervised learning tasks. In particular, we first look at the standard image classification tasks using the Fashion-MNIST dataset and study the effect of repeating tensor network layers on ansatz's expressibility and performance. Finally, we use this strategy to tackle the problem of quantum phase recognition for the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg spin models in one and two dimensions, where we were able to reach ≥98% test-set accuracies with both multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and tree tensor network (TTN) inspired parametrized quantum circuits.}

We provide an overview of fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry, including the basic principles of the Hartree-Fock method. A flagship feature in PennyLane is the differentiable Hartree-Fock solver, allowing users to compute exact gradients of molecular Hamiltonians with respect to nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters. PennyLane provides specialized operations for quantum chemistry, including excitation gates as Givens rotations and templates for quantum chemistry circuits. Moreover, built-in simulators exploit sparse matrix techniques for representing molecular Hamiltonians that lead to fast simulation for quantum chemistry applications. In combination with PennyLane's existing methods for constructing, optimizing, and executing circuits, these methods allow users to implement a wide range of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. We discuss how PennyLane can be used to implement variational algorithms for calculating ground-state energies, excited-state energies, and energy derivatives, all of which can be differentiated with respect to both circuit and Hamiltonian parameters. We provide an example workflow describing how to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear coordinates, and basis set parameters for quantum chemistry algorithms. We discuss a functionality for reducing the number of qubits by using symmetries and explain how PennyLane can be used to estimate quantum resources needed to implement several quantum algorithms. By combining insights from quantum computing, computational chemistry, and machine learning, PennyLane is the first library for differentiable quantum computational chemistry.},

	abstract    = {We explore the practicality of early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, focusing on ground-state energy estimation problems. Specifically, we address the computation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the spectral measure of the Hamiltonian and the identification of its discontinuities. Scaling to bigger system sizes unveils three challenges: the smoothness of the CDF for large supports, the absence of tight lower bounds on the overlap with the actual ground state, and the complexity of preparing high-quality initial states. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a signal processing technique for identifying the inflection point of the CDF. We argue that this change of paradigm significantly simplifies the problem, making it more accessible while still being accurate. Hence, instead of trying to find the exact ground-state energy, we advocate improving on the classical estimate by aiming at the low-energy support of the initial state. Furthermore, we offer quantitative resource estimates for the maximum number of samples required to identify an increase in the CDF of a given size. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on a 26-qubit fully-connected Heisenberg model using a truncated density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) initial state of low bond dimension. Results show that the prediction obtained with the quantum algorithm aligns well with the DMRG-converged energy at large bond dimensions and requires several orders of magnitude fewer samples than predicted by the theory. Hence, we argue that CDF-based quantum algorithms are a viable, practical alternative to quantum phase estimation in resource-limited scenarios.},
