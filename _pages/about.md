I am a researcher working on quantum algorithms and quantum software. Currently, I am at [Xanadu](https://www.xanadu.ai/) as a Quantum Scientist in their algorithms team, focused on researching quantum algorithms related to quantum chemistry and quantum simulations and incorporating them into [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/). My research interests lie in the physics of computation. More particularly, using quantum computation to solve important problems in natural sciences. I occasionally employ machine learning and complex systems for this purpose. 

Prior to this, I was a master's student at the [Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB)](https://ccnsb.iiit.ac.in/) and the [Centre for Quantum Science and Technology (CQST)](https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](http://iiit.ac.in), advised by Professor [Harjinder Singh](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~laltu/). Simultaneously, I was working as a researcher at the [Theoretical Quantum Physics Laboratory](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/chief/theor_qtm_phys/), [RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/), on coherent Ising machines (CIM) with Professor [Franco Nori](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SRUYLREAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining his lab, I was at [QpiAI Pvt. Ltd.](https://qpiai.tech/) as a quantum compute researcher, where I worked on developing quantum, quantum-inspired algorithms and a full software stack for their quantum hardware, [Trion](https://qpiai.tech/QpiAiHardware).

I am also part of [IBM Quantum Research Programme](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) and a [Qiskit Advocate](https://qiskit.org/advocates/). Along with this, I've been an active contributor to [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) community, and [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF)](https://qosf.org/) projects. I have also developed my own visualization tool for analyzing parameterized quantum circuits called [qLEET](https://github.com/QLemma/qleet/), that was supported by [Unitary Fund](https://www.unitary.fund). 
 
In the past, I've also worked with Professor [Apoorva Patel](Apoorva D Patel) at [IISc, Bangalore](http://iisc.ac.in/), and Professor [Prasanta K. Panigrahi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sNq6fwwAAAAJ&hl=en) at [IISER Kolkata](http://iiserkol.ac.in/). The projects majorly focused on simulation, development and application of NISQ Algorithms. Finally, before stepping into the quantum realm, I was working in an experimental biophysics laboratory under the guidance of Professor [Musti J. Swamy](http://chemistry.uohyd.ac.in/~mjs/) at the [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/).

<h3> Current Focus </h3>

My main focus right now is on developing efficient decompositions of single-qubit unitaries into Clifford+T basis and understanding quantum dynamics of coherent Ising machines.
